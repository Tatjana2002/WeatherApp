Weather App is an API-based application that displays real-time weather forecasts for major cities across Europe. When a user selects a specific city, the current weather details are shown. The app also provides a 5-day weather forecast for the selected city. By clicking on any day in the table, the application displays detailed weather measurements recorded every three hours for that day.
